    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Hello World</h2>

<p>Today I decided (again) to really start my own blog. I always wanted to write about my daily experiences but never really started. But now is the time to start another try. I will write about web development in general, especially about Ruby on Rails. My passion is not only about development itself but also about the process around it. I belief that beautiful code has its source in great companies, that's why I will also write about management and processes. I am one of the founders at <a href="http://galaxycats.com">Galaxy Cats</a> and will start to work for a new startup by the first of july.</p>

<p>So stay tuned and hopefully my self-discipline will drive me to write some posts in the near future.</p>
