Hi, my name is Andreas Bade and i am a passionate web developer. I really like to write beautiful ruby code which normaly runs in a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) web application. I am one of the founders at [Galaxy Cats IT Consulting GmbH](http://galaxycats.com) where we are focusing on supporting startups from the very first line of code to develop high quality web apps. My personal interest about (rails) web applications is to bring more modularity and flexibility to big code bases by introducing concepts which other worlds (for example the java community) already introduced long time ago. I think we can learn much about good software design from these approaches.

Besides that i care much about the processes of the companys i work for. I think agile development processes are saving the world and that should be the way to build an enthusiastic development team delivering new great features in a blink of an eye.

If you try to find me in the web lookout for my [gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com/)
